# Python-Case-Study
Case study completed for USF Data Analysis Bootcamp using Jupyter Notebook and Python

## Project objective
The objective of this case study project was to utilize Jupyter Notebook and Python to conduct data analysis and create data visualizations for two synthetic dataframes depicting data from "Southern Water Corp"

## Datasets used
Two synthetic dataframes containing 2000+ rows and 10 columns each were utilized for this project

## Methods
Utilized Jupyter Notebook, Python, and libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels

## Stages
1. Importing datasets from CSV files
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Generation of descriptive statistics for each dataframe
4. Data cleaning
5. Data manipulation including subsetting and filtering dataframes, and use of for loops
6. Data visualizations including box plots, line plots, dual axis plots, and heatmaps
7. Creation of multivariate regression model, analysis of coefficients, and validation of predictions
